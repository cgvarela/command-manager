# Update Disabled Users
This project was started because of SOC requirements (not to mention it just being a good idea) that all internal systems need to ensure users are disabled globally.

Example is when a user leaves the company; all accounts must be disabled. Rather than relying on someone remembering to go into MicroStrategy and disable the user; we build an automated process.
## Installation
Copy the applicable procedure to your "User Procedures" folder then restart Command Manager.

Example folder path: C:\Program Files (x86)\MicroStrategy\Command Manager\Outlines\Procedure_Outlines\User_Procedures

## How To Use

Steps to use procedures in this repo:

Clone the repo and copy the procedures you like to {Command Manager folder}/Outlines/Procedure_Outlines/User_Procedure.
Re-launch Command Manager.
You'll find the procedure appears in the CM Outline window, under Procedure_Outlines > User_Procedures. The instruction of the procedure will be show in the outline. You can provide parameters according to the Samples and execute the procedure.

You can always refer to the Procedure related topics in Command Manager Help document for more information.
